# Goldbach-Conjecture
Testing the Goldbach Conjecture for prime numbers.
The Goldbach conjecture is as follows: Every even natural number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes.
This is my first attempt at a C++ project. I feel like it is simple and provides a way that shows computing can check conjectures up to a certain value.
Please note that this conjecture has been tested up to integers less than 4 x 10^18 (Which is considerably large). It is my hope that down the road as I gain more coding skills that I will be able to revisit this project at a later date and further improve the code to check the conjecture for higher numbers.

UPDATE 1-10-25
Added the ability for the program to check how many different ways an even number can be written as a prime.
